# Oveview of the analysis
An analysis of temperature data was completed to determine the feasibility of running a surf shop year round. After reviewing the original analysis, a more in depth analysis was completed which compared tempartures statistics in June and December. These months were looked at as they are opposite ends of the year. Summary statistics were used to break down each month.
## Results
The temperature in June was warm (max temp: 85F, min temp: 64F, mean temp: 75F). Additionally, the variablity was low (std: 3.3) meaning that the temperature did not fluctuate much.

The temperature in December was also warm and very similar to June (max temp: 83F, min temp: 56F, mean temp: 71F). The variability was also low in December (std: 3.75)

The data is robust as there are 1700 data points in June and 1517 data points in December.
### Summary
From the data analzyed, the similarities in temperature between June and December lead us to believe thatis feasible to have the surf shop open all year. There are limitations to the analysis though, specifically the data that was not analyzed. There are more factors that impact surfing conditions: precipitation, wind speed, sunrise/sunset times, and tides. With the analysis template that was created, more queries can be easily run with additional data.
